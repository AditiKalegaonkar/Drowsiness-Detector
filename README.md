# Drowsiness-Detector
The project entails the development of a system that integrates hardware components such as a camera and microcontroller with software algorithms for real-time drowsiness detection within a vehicle.

###	Libraries and Modules Used:
1.	scipy. spatial.distance: Used for computing the Euclidean distance between points.
2.	Imutils: Provides convenience functions for basic image processing tasks.
3.	pygame.mixer: Enables playing sound files for auditory alerts.
4.	lib: Used for face detection and facial landmark detection.
5.	cv2 (OpenCV): Utilized for video capture, image processing, and displaying frames from the camera feed.
6.	serial: Allows communication with serial ports for controlling external hardware (e.g., Arduino).
7.	time: Used for timing-related operations, such as setting delays and tracking elapsed time.
